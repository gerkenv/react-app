# React Applications
Remarks are based on the course 

## 1. Basic React

### Initial Project Structure
Checkout branch "basic-react-initial-structure" to get initial project structure.
Now let's take a look to the `<body>` section of our template page located at `./dist/index.html`.
```html
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <script src="./client.min.js"></script>
</body>
```
The `<div` element was marked here with `Ã¬d="app"`. It is the container for our application.
`<script>` includes built version of our code and it is located in `./dist/client.min.js`.

Our main source file `./src/client.js` is minimal react application:
```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

class Layout extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>It works!</h1>
    );
  }
}

const app = document.getElementById('app');
ReactDOM.render(<Layout/>, app);
```
It includes `React` and `ReactDOM`- which is our rendering engine. 
It has a class called `Layout` that based on `React.Component` class. \
Anyway, everything in `react` is a component. The same way as everything in `html` page is an element.
For very basic `react` component it is enough to have only a `render()` method. \
Main part of the `render()` method is the `.jsx` expression enclosed into parenthesis, that is actually `html` that will be converted to "javascript created html elements".
So our `<h1>` element will be something like:
```js
var h1 = document.createElement("h1");
h1.innerHTML = "It works";
```
To make work with `jsx` easier you will need a `jsx` plugin for your text editor.

So now we have a component that has enclosed HTML, what's next? We need to show on the page somehow. That's where `ReactDOM` comes into play. Remember that we have defined the `div` element with `id="app"`? We will get this element and render our component inside of it.
```js
const app = document.getElementById('app');
ReactDOM.render(<Layout/>, app);
```

### Live Reloading
Basically you have 2 simple ways to hold a project to be live reloaded. \
* First one is to call `webpack --watch` from your working directory `1-basic-react`.
* Use `webpack-dev-server`. Install it with NPM then start it `webpack-dev-server --content-base src` from directory `1-basic-react`.

In both cases you have to install `webpack` & `webpack-dev-server` globally. It is not the cleanest way to use these things.

```js

```
